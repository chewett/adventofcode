Chewett Advent of Code repo
===========================

This holds all my solutions for Advent of code including unit tests.

While I normally program in less strongly typed languages I decided that I wanted to solve these problems in a
 strongly typed language. Java has a lot of nice abstractions while also allowing you to pick the
 implementation of various structures (e.g. List can be backed by various types of list, depending on need).

While doing this I have built up a library of helpers which allow me to solve the problems abstracting away a lot
 of the boilerplate focussing on the algorithms. See
 [Discrete2DPositionGrid](src/main/java/net/chewett/adventofcode/datastructures/Discrete2DPositionGrid.java)

### 2023 "5 am" start results

In 2023 I woke around 5am most morning to code the puzzles.
I was very pleased to get in the top 1000 some days. My leaderboard results are:
