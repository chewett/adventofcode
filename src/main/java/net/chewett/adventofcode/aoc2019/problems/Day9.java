/**
 * Awesome problem taken from: https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/9
 * Go have a try yourself!
 *
 * --- Day 9: Sensor Boost ---
 * You've just said goodbye to the rebooted rover and left Mars when you receive a faint distress signal coming from
 * the asteroid belt. It must be the Ceres monitoring station!
 *
 * In order to lock on to the signal, you'll need to boost your sensors. The Elves send up the latest BOOST program -
 * Basic Operation Of System Test.
 *
 * While BOOST (your puzzle input) is capable of boosting your sensors, for tenuous safety reasons, it refuses to do
 * so until the computer it runs on passes some checks to demonstrate it is a complete Intcode computer.
 *
 * Your existing Intcode computer is missing one key feature: it needs support for parameters in relative mode.
 *
 * Parameters in mode 2, relative mode, behave very similarly to parameters in position mode: the parameter is
 * interpreted as a position. Like position mode, parameters in relative mode can be read from or written to.
 *
 * The important difference is that relative mode parameters don't count from address 0. Instead, they count from a
 * value called the relative base. The relative base starts at 0.
 *
 * The address a relative mode parameter refers to is itself plus the current relative base. When the relative base
 * is 0, relative mode parameters and position mode parameters with the same value refer to the same address.
 *
 * For example, given a relative base of 50, a relative mode parameter of -7 refers to memory address 50 + -7 = 43.
 *
 * The relative base is modified with the relative base offset instruction:
 *
 * Opcode 9 adjusts the relative base by the value of its only parameter. The relative base increases (or decreases,
 * if the value is negative) by the value of the parameter.
 * For example, if the relative base is 2000, then after the instruction 109,19, the relative base would be 2019. If
 * the next instruction were 204,-34, then the value at address 1985 would be output.
 *
 * Your Intcode computer will also need a few other capabilities:
 *
 * The computer's available memory should be much larger than the initial program. Memory beyond the initial program
 * starts with the value 0 and can be read or written like any other memory. (It is invalid to try to access memory at
 * a negative address, though.)
 * The computer should have support for large numbers. Some instructions near the beginning of the BOOST program will
 * verify this capability.
 * Here are some example programs that use these features:
 *
 * 109,1,204,-1,1001,100,1,100,1008,100,16,101,1006,101,0,99 takes no input and produces a copy of itself as output.
 * 1102,34915192,34915192,7,4,7,99,0 should output a 16-digit number.
 * 104,1125899906842624,99 should output the large number in the middle.
 * The BOOST program will ask for a single input; run it in test mode by providing it the value 1. It will perform a
 * series of checks on each opcode, output any opcodes (and the associated parameter modes) that seem to be functioning
 * incorrectly, and finally output a BOOST keycode.
 *
 * Once your Intcode computer is fully functional, the BOOST program should report no malfunctioning opcodes when run
 * in test mode; it should only output a single value, the BOOST keycode. What BOOST keycode does it produce?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 * You now have a complete Intcode computer.
 *
 * Finally, you can lock on to the Ceres distress signal! You just need to boost your sensors using the BOOST program.
 *
 * The program runs in sensor boost mode by providing the input instruction the value 2. Once run, it will boost the
 * sensors automatically, but it might take a few seconds to complete the operation on slower hardware. In sensor boost
 * mode, the program will output a single value: the coordinates of the distress signal.
 *
 * Run the BOOST program in sensor boost mode. What are the coordinates of the distress signal?
 *
