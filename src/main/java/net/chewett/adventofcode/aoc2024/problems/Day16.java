/**
 * --- Day 16: Reindeer Maze ---
 * It's time again for the Reindeer Olympics! This year, the big event is the Reindeer Maze, where the Reindeer
 * compete for the lowest score.
 *
 * You and The Historians arrive to search for the Chief right as the event is about to start. It wouldn't hurt
 * to watch a little, right?
 *
 * The Reindeer start on the Start Tile (marked S) facing East and need to reach the End Tile (marked E). They can
 * move forward one tile at a time (increasing their score by 1 point), but never into a wall (#). They can also
 * rotate clockwise or counterclockwise 90 degrees at a time (increasing their score by 1000 points).
 *
 * To figure out the best place to sit, you start by grabbing a map (your puzzle input) from a nearby kiosk. For
 * example:
 *
 * ###############
 * #.......#....E#
 * #.#.###.#.###.#
 * #.....#.#...#.#
 * #.###.#####.#.#
 * #.#.#.......#.#
 * #.#.#####.###.#
 * #...........#.#
 * ###.#.#####.#.#
 * #...#.....#.#.#
 * #.#.#.###.#.#.#
 * #.....#...#.#.#
 * #.###.#.#.#.#.#
 * #S..#.....#...#
 * ###############
 * There are many paths through this maze, but taking any of the best paths would incur a score of only 7036. This can
 * be achieved by taking a total of 36 steps forward and turning 90 degrees a total of 7 times:
 *
 *
 * ###############
 * #.......#....E#
 * #.#.###.#.###^#
 * #.....#.#...#^#
 * #.###.#####.#^#
 * #.#.#.......#^#
 * #.#.#####.###^#
 * #..>>>>>>>>v#^#
 * ###^#.#####v#^#
 * #>>^#.....#v#^#
 * #^#.#.###.#v#^#
 * #^....#...#v#^#
 * #^###.#.#.#v#^#
 * #S..#.....#>>^#
 * ###############
 * Here's a second example:
 *
 * #################
 * #...#...#...#..E#
 * #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#
 * #.#.#.#...#...#.#
 * #.#.#.#.###.#.#.#
 * #...#.#.#.....#.#
 * #.#.#.#.#.#####.#
 * #.#...#.#.#.....#
 * #.#.#####.#.###.#
 * #.#.#.......#...#
 * #.#.###.#####.###
 * #.#.#...#.....#.#
 * #.#.#.#####.###.#
 * #.#.#.........#.#
 * #.#.#.#########.#
 * #S#.............#
 * #################
 * In this maze, the best paths cost 11048 points; following one such path would look like this:
 *
 * #################
 * #...#...#...#..E#
 * #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#^#
 * #.#.#.#...#...#^#
 * #.#.#.#.###.#.#^#
 * #>>v#.#.#.....#^#
 * #^#v#.#.#.#####^#
 * #^#v..#.#.#>>>>^#
 * #^#v#####.#^###.#
 * #^#v#..>>>>^#...#
 * #^#v###^#####.###
 * #^#v#>>^#.....#.#
 * #^#v#^#####.###.#
 * #^#v#^........#.#
 * #^#v#^#########.#
 * #S#>>^..........#
 * #################
 * Note that the path shown above includes one 90 degree turn as the very first move, rotating the Reindeer from facing
 * East to facing North.
 *
 * Analyze your map carefully. What is the lowest score a Reindeer could possibly get?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 * Now that you know what the best paths look like, you can figure out the best spot to sit.
 *
 * Every non-wall tile (S, ., or E) is equipped with places to sit along the edges of the tile. While determining
 * which of these tiles would be the best spot to sit depends on a whole bunch of factors (how comfortable the seats
 * are, how far away the bathrooms are, whether there's a pillar blocking your view, etc.), the most important factor
 * is whether the tile is on one of the best paths through the maze. If you sit somewhere else, you'd miss all the
 * action!
 *
 * So, you'll need to determine which tiles are part of any best path through the maze, including the S and E tiles.
 *
 * In the first example, there are 45 tiles (marked O) that are part of at least one of the various best paths through
 * the maze:
 *
 * ###############
 * #.......#....O#
 * #.#.###.#.###O#
 * #.....#.#...#O#
 * #.###.#####.#O#
 * #.#.#.......#O#
 * #.#.#####.###O#
 * #..OOOOOOOOO#O#
 * ###O#O#####O#O#
 * #OOO#O....#O#O#
 * #O#O#O###.#O#O#
 * #OOOOO#...#O#O#
 * #O###.#.#.#O#O#
 * #O..#.....#OOO#
 * ###############
 * In the second example, there are 64 tiles that are part of at least one of the best paths:
 *
 * #################
 * #...#...#...#..O#
 * #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#O#
 * #.#.#.#...#...#O#
 * #.#.#.#.###.#.#O#
 * #OOO#.#.#.....#O#
 * #O#O#.#.#.#####O#
 * #O#O..#.#.#OOOOO#
 * #O#O#####.#O###O#
 * #O#O#..OOOOO#OOO#
 * #O#O###O#####O###
 * #O#O#OOO#..OOO#.#
 * #O#O#O#####O###.#
 * #O#O#OOOOOOO..#.#
 * #O#O#O#########.#
 * #O#OOO..........#
 * #################
 * Analyze your map further. How many tiles are part of at least one of the best paths through the maze?
