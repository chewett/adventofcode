/**
 * --- Day 12: Garden Groups ---
 * Why not search for the Chief Historian near the gardener and his massive farm? There's plenty of food, so The
 * Historians grab something to eat while they search.
 *
 * You're about to settle near a complex arrangement of garden plots when some Elves ask if you can lend a hand. They'd
 * like to set up fences around each region of garden plots, but they can't figure out how much fence they need to order
 * or how much it will cost. They hand you a map (your puzzle input) of the garden plots.
 *
 * Each garden plot grows only a single type of plant and is indicated by a single letter on your map. When multiple
 * garden plots are growing the same type of plant and are touching (horizontally or vertically), they form a region.
 * For example:
 *
 * AAAA
 * BBCD
 * BBCC
 * EEEC
 * This 4x4 arrangement includes garden plots growing five different types of plants (labeled A, B, C, D, and E), each
 * grouped into their own region.
 *
 * In order to accurately calculate the cost of the fence around a single region, you need to know that region's area
 * and perimeter.
 *
 * The area of a region is simply the number of garden plots the region contains. The above map's type A, B, and C
 * plants are each in a region of area 4. The type E plants are in a region of area 3; the type D plants are in a region
 * of area 1.
 *
 * Each garden plot is a square and so has four sides. The perimeter of a region is the number of sides of garden plots
 * in the region that do not touch another garden plot in the same region. The type A and C plants are each in a region
 * with perimeter 10. The type B and E plants are each in a region with perimeter 8. The lone D plot forms its own
 * region with perimeter 4.
 *
 * Visually indicating the sides of plots in each region that contribute to the perimeter using - and |, the above
 * map's regions' perimeters are measured as follows:
 *
 * +-+-+-+-+
 * |A A A A|
 * +-+-+-+-+     +-+
 *               |D|
 * +-+-+   +-+   +-+
 * |B B|   |C|
 * +   +   + +-+
 * |B B|   |C C|
 * +-+-+   +-+ +
 *           |C|
 * +-+-+-+   +-+
 * |E E E|
 * +-+-+-+
 * Plants of the same type can appear in multiple separate regions, and regions can even appear within other regions.
 * For example:
 *
 * OOOOO
 * OXOXO
 * OOOOO
 * OXOXO
 * OOOOO
 * The above map contains five regions, one containing all of the O garden plots, and the other four each containing a
 * single X plot.
 *
 * The four X regions each have area 1 and perimeter 4. The region containing 21 type O plants is more complicated; in
 * addition to its outer edge contributing a perimeter of 20, its boundary with each X region contributes an additional
 * 4 to its perimeter, for a total perimeter of 36.
 *
 * Due to "modern" business practices, the price of fence required for a region is found by multiplying that region's
 * area by its perimeter. The total price of fencing all regions on a map is found by adding together the price of
 * fence for every region on the map.
 *
 * In the first example, region A has price 4 * 10 = 40, region B has price 4 * 8 = 32, region C has price 4 * 10 = 40,
 * region D has price 1 * 4 = 4, and region E has price 3 * 8 = 24. So, the total price for the first example is 140.
 *
 * In the second example, the region with all of the O plants has price 21 * 36 = 756, and each of the four smaller X
 * regions has price 1 * 4 = 4, for a total price of 772 (756 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4).
 *
 * Here's a larger example:
 *
 * RRRRIICCFF
 * RRRRIICCCF
 * VVRRRCCFFF
 * VVRCCCJFFF
 * VVVVCJJCFE
 * VVIVCCJJEE
 * VVIIICJJEE
 * MIIIIIJJEE
 * MIIISIJEEE
 * MMMISSJEEE
 * It contains:
 *
 * A region of R plants with price 12 * 18 = 216.
 * A region of I plants with price 4 * 8 = 32.
 * A region of C plants with price 14 * 28 = 392.
 * A region of F plants with price 10 * 18 = 180.
 * A region of V plants with price 13 * 20 = 260.
 * A region of J plants with price 11 * 20 = 220.
 * A region of C plants with price 1 * 4 = 4.
 * A region of E plants with price 13 * 18 = 234.
 * A region of I plants with price 14 * 22 = 308.
 * A region of M plants with price 5 * 12 = 60.
 * A region of S plants with price 3 * 8 = 24.
 * So, it has a total price of 1930.
 *
 * What is the total price of fencing all regions on your map?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 * Fortunately, the Elves are trying to order so much fence that they qualify for a bulk discount!
 *
 * Under the bulk discount, instead of using the perimeter to calculate the price, you need to use the number of sides
 * each region has. Each straight section of fence counts as a side, regardless of how long it is.
 *
 * Consider this example again:
 *
 * AAAA
 * BBCD
 * BBCC
 * EEEC
 * The region containing type A plants has 4 sides, as does each of the regions containing plants of type B, D, and E.
 * However, the more complex region containing the plants of type C has 8 sides!
 *
 * Using the new method of calculating the per-region price by multiplying the region's area by its number of sides,
 * regions A through E have prices 16, 16, 32, 4, and 12, respectively, for a total price of 80.
 *
 * The second example above (full of type X and O plants) would have a total price of 436.
 *
 * Here's a map that includes an E-shaped region full of type E plants:
 *
 * EEEEE
 * EXXXX
 * EEEEE
 * EXXXX
 * EEEEE
 * The E-shaped region has an area of 17 and 12 sides for a price of 204. Including the two regions full of type X
 * plants, this map has a total price of 236.
 *
 * This map has a total price of 368:
 *
 * AAAAAA
 * AAABBA
 * AAABBA
 * ABBAAA
 * ABBAAA
 * AAAAAA
 * It includes two regions full of type B plants (each with 4 sides) and a single region full of type A plants (with 4
 * sides on the outside and 8 more sides on the inside, a total of 12 sides). Be especially careful when counting the
 * fence around regions like the one full of type A plants; in particular, each section of fence has an in-side and an
 * out-side, so the fence does not connect across the middle of the region (where the two B regions touch diagonally).
 * (The Elves would have used the MÃ¶bius Fencing Company instead, but their contract terms were too one-sided.)
 *
 * The larger example from before now has the following updated prices:
 *
 * A region of R plants with price 12 * 10 = 120.
 * A region of I plants with price 4 * 4 = 16.
 * A region of C plants with price 14 * 22 = 308.
 * A region of F plants with price 10 * 12 = 120.
 * A region of V plants with price 13 * 10 = 130.
 * A region of J plants with price 11 * 12 = 132.
 * A region of C plants with price 1 * 4 = 4.
 * A region of E plants with price 13 * 8 = 104.
 * A region of I plants with price 14 * 16 = 224.
 * A region of M plants with price 5 * 6 = 30.
 * A region of S plants with price 3 * 6 = 18.
 * Adding these together produces its new total price of 1206.
