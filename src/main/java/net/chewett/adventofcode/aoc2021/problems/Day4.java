/**
 * --- Day 4: Giant Squid ---
 * You're already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean, already so deep that you can't see any
 * sunlight. What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.
 *
 * Maybe it wants to play bingo?
 *
 * Bingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers. Numbers are chosen at random, and the
 * chosen number is marked on all boards on which it appears. (Numbers may not appear on all boards.) If all numbers in
 * any row or any column of a board are marked, that board wins. (Diagonals don't count.)
 *
 * The submarine has a bingo subsystem to help passengers (currently, you and the giant squid) pass the time. It
 * automatically generates a random order in which to draw numbers and a random set of boards (your puzzle input).
 * For example:
 *
 * 7,4,9,5,11,17,23,2,0,14,21,24,10,16,13,6,15,25,12,22,18,20,8,19,3,26,1
 *
 * 22 13 17 11  0
 *  8  2 23  4 24
 * 21  9 14 16  7
 *  6 10  3 18  5
 *  1 12 20 15 19
 *
 *  3 15  0  2 22
 *  9 18 13 17  5
 * 19  8  7 25 23
 * 20 11 10 24  4
 * 14 21 16 12  6
 *
 * 14 21 17 24  4
 * 10 16 15  9 19
 * 18  8 23 26 20
 * 22 11 13  6  5
 *  2  0 12  3  7
 * After the first five numbers are drawn (7, 4, 9, 5, and 11), there are no winners, but the boards are marked as
 * follows (shown here adjacent to each other to save space):
 *
 * 22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4
 *  8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19
 * 21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20
 *  6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5
 *  1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7
 * After the next six numbers are drawn (17, 23, 2, 0, 14, and 21), there are still no winners:
 *
 * 22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4
 *  8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19
 * 21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20
 *  6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5
 *  1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7
 * Finally, 24 is drawn:
 *
 * 22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4
 *  8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19
 * 21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20
 *  6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5
 *  1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7
 * At this point, the third board wins because it has at least one complete row or column of marked numbers (in this
 * case, the entire top row is marked: 14 21 17 24 4).
 *
 * The score of the winning board can now be calculated. Start by finding the sum of all unmarked numbers on that
 * board; in this case, the sum is 188. Then, multiply that sum by the number that was just called when the board won,
 * 24, to get the final score, 188 * 24 = 4512.
 *
 * To guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will win first. What will your final score be
 * if you choose that board?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 * On the other hand, it might be wise to try a different strategy: let the giant squid win.
 *
 * You aren't sure how many bingo boards a giant squid could play at once, so rather than waste time counting its arms,
 * the safe thing to do is to figure out which board will win last and choose that one. That way, no matter which
 * boards it picks, it will win for sure.
 *
 * In the above example, the second board is the last to win, which happens after 13 is eventually called and its
 * middle column is completely marked. If you were to keep playing until this point, the second board would have a sum
 * of unmarked numbers equal to 148 for a final score of 148 * 13 = 1924.
 *
 * Figure out which board will win last. Once it wins, what would its final score be?
