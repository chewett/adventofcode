/**
 * --- Day 14: Parabolic Reflector Dish ---
 * You reach the place where all of the mirrors were pointing: a massive parabolic reflector dish attached to the side
 * of another large mountain.
 *
 * The dish is made up of many small mirrors, but while the mirrors themselves are roughly in the shape of a parabolic
 * reflector dish, each individual mirror seems to be pointing in slightly the wrong direction. If the dish is meant
 * to focus light, all it's doing right now is sending it in a vague direction.
 *
 * This system must be what provides the energy for the lava! If you focus the reflector dish, maybe you can go where
 * it's pointing and use the light to fix the lava production.
 *
 * Upon closer inspection, the individual mirrors each appear to be connected via an elaborate system of ropes and
 * pulleys to a large metal platform below the dish. The platform is covered in large rocks of various shapes.
 * Depending on their position, the weight of the rocks deforms the platform, and the shape of the platform controls
 * which ropes move and ultimately the focus of the dish.
 *
 * In short: if you move the rocks, you can focus the dish. The platform even has a control panel on the side that
 * lets you tilt it in one of four directions! The rounded rocks (O) will roll when the platform is tilted,
 * while the cube-shaped rocks (#) will stay in place. You note the positions of all of the empty spaces (.)
 * and rocks (your puzzle input). For example:
 *
 * O....#....
 * O.OO#....#
 * .....##...
 * OO.#O....O
 * .O.....O#.
 * O.#..O.#.#
 * ..O..#O..O
 * .......O..
 * #....###..
 * #OO..#....
 * Start by tilting the lever so all of the rocks will slide north as far as they will go:
 *
 * OOOO.#.O..
 * OO..#....#
 * OO..O##..O
 * O..#.OO...
 * ........#.
 * ..#....#.#
 * ..O..#.O.O
 * ..O.......
 * #....###..
 * #....#....
 * You notice that the support beams along the north side of the platform are damaged; to ensure the platform doesn't
 * collapse, you should calculate the total load on the north support beams.
 *
 * The amount of load caused by a single rounded rock (O) is equal to the number of rows from the rock to the south
 * edge of the platform, including the row the rock is on. (Cube-shaped rocks (#) don't contribute to load.) So, the
 * amount of load caused by each rock in each row is as follows:
 *
 * OOOO.#.O.. 10
 * OO..#....#  9
 * OO..O##..O  8
 * O..#.OO...  7
 * ........#.  6
 * ..#....#.#  5
 * ..O..#.O.O  4
 * ..O.......  3
 * #....###..  2
 * #....#....  1
 * The total load is the sum of the load caused by all of the rounded rocks. In this example, the total load is 136.
 *
 * Tilt the platform so that the rounded rocks all roll north. Afterward, what is the total load on the north support
 * beams?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 * The parabolic reflector dish deforms, but not in a way that focuses the beam. To do that, you'll need to move the
 * rocks to the edges of the platform. Fortunately, a button on the side of the control panel labeled "spin cycle"
 * attempts to do just that!
 *
 * Each cycle tilts the platform four times so that the rounded rocks roll north, then west, then south, then east.
 * After each tilt, the rounded rocks roll as far as they can before the platform tilts in the next direction. After
 * one cycle, the platform will have finished rolling the rounded rocks in those four directions in that order.
 *
 * Here's what happens in the example above after each of the first few cycles:
 *
 * After 1 cycle:
 * .....#....
 * ....#...O#
 * ...OO##...
 * .OO#......
 * .....OOO#.
 * .O#...O#.#
 * ....O#....
 * ......OOOO
 * #...O###..
 * #..OO#....
 *
 * After 2 cycles:
 * .....#....
 * ....#...O#
 * .....##...
 * ..O#......
 * .....OOO#.
 * .O#...O#.#
 * ....O#...O
 * .......OOO
 * #..OO###..
 * #.OOO#...O
 *
 * After 3 cycles:
 * .....#....
 * ....#...O#
 * .....##...
 * ..O#......
 * .....OOO#.
 * .O#...O#.#
 * ....O#...O
 * .......OOO
 * #...O###.O
 * #.OOO#...O
 * This process should work if you leave it running long enough, but you're still worried about the north support
 * beams. To make sure they'll survive for a while, you need to calculate the total load on the north support beams
 * after 1000000000 cycles.
 *
 * In the above example, after 1000000000 cycles, the total load on the north support beams is 64.
 *
 * Run the spin cycle for 1000000000 cycles. Afterward, what is the total load on the north support beams?
