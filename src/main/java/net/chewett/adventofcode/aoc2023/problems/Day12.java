/**
 * --- Day 12: Hot Springs ---
 * You finally reach the hot springs! You can see steam rising from secluded areas attached to the primary, ornate
 * building.
 *
 * As you turn to enter, the researcher stops you. "Wait - I thought you were looking for the hot springs, weren't
 * you?" You indicate that this definitely looks like hot springs to you.
 *
 * "Oh, sorry, common mistake! This is actually the onsen! The hot springs are next door."
 *
 * You look in the direction the researcher is pointing and suddenly notice the massive metal helixes towering
 * overhead. "This way!"
 *
 * It only takes you a few more steps to reach the main gate of the massive fenced-off area containing the springs.
 * You go through the gate and into a small administrative building.
 *
 * "Hello! What brings you to the hot springs today? Sorry they're not very hot right now; we're having a lava
 * shortage at the moment." You ask about the missing machine parts for Desert Island.
 *
 * "Oh, all of Gear Island is currently offline! Nothing is being manufactured at the moment, not until we get more
 * lava to heat our forges. And our springs. The springs aren't very springy unless they're hot!"
 *
 * "Say, could you go up and see why the lava stopped flowing? The springs are too cold for normal operation, but we
 * should be able to find one springy enough to launch you up there!"
 *
 * There's just one problem - many of the springs have fallen into disrepair, so they're not actually sure which
 * springs would even be safe to use! Worse yet, their condition records of which springs are damaged (your puzzle
 * input) are also damaged! You'll need to help them repair the damaged records.
 *
 * In the giant field just outside, the springs are arranged into rows. For each row, the condition records show
 * every spring and whether it is operational (.) or damaged (#). This is the part of the condition records that is
 * itself damaged; for some springs, it is simply unknown (?) whether the spring is operational or damaged.
 *
 * However, the engineer that produced the condition records also duplicated some of this information in a different
 * format! After the list of springs for a given row, the size of each contiguous group of damaged springs is listed
 * in the order those groups appear in the row. This list always accounts for every damaged spring, and each number is
 * the entire size of its contiguous group (that is, groups are always separated by at least one operational
 * spring: #### would always be 4, never 2,2).
 *
 * So, condition records with no unknown spring conditions might look like this:
 *
 * #.#.### 1,1,3
 * .#...#....###. 1,1,3
 * .#.###.#.###### 1,3,1,6
 * ####.#...#... 4,1,1
 * #....######..#####. 1,6,5
 * .###.##....# 3,2,1
 * However, the condition records are partially damaged; some of the springs' conditions are actually unknown (?).
 * For example:
 *
 * ???.### 1,1,3
 * .??..??...?##. 1,1,3
 * ?#?#?#?#?#?#?#? 1,3,1,6
 * ????.#...#... 4,1,1
 * ????.######..#####. 1,6,5
 * ?###???????? 3,2,1
 * Equipped with this information, it is your job to figure out how many different arrangements of operational and
 * broken springs fit the given criteria in each row.
 *
 * In the first line (???.### 1,1,3), there is exactly one way separate groups of one, one, and three broken springs
 * (in that order) can appear in that row: the first three unknown springs must be broken, then operational, then
 * broken (#.#), making the whole row #.#.###.
 *
 * The second line is more interesting: .??..??...?##. 1,1,3 could be a total of four different arrangements. The
 * last ? must always be broken (to satisfy the final contiguous group of three broken springs), and each ?? must
 * hide exactly one of the two broken springs. (Neither ?? could be both broken springs or they would form a single
 * contiguous group of two; if that were true, the numbers afterward would have been 2,3 instead.) Since each ?? can
 * either be #. or .#, there are four possible arrangements of springs.
 *
 * The last line is actually consistent with ten different arrangements! Because the first number is 3, the first and
 * second ? must both be . (if either were #, the first number would have to be 4 or higher). However, the remaining
 * run of unknown spring conditions have many different ways they could hold groups of two and one broken springs:
 *
 * ?###???????? 3,2,1
 * .###.##.#...
 * .###.##..#..
 * .###.##...#.
 * .###.##....#
 * .###..##.#..
 * .###..##..#.
 * .###..##...#
 * .###...##.#.
 * .###...##..#
 * .###....##.#
 * In this example, the number of possible arrangements for each row is:
 *
 * ???.### 1,1,3 - 1 arrangement
 * .??..??...?##. 1,1,3 - 4 arrangements
 * ?#?#?#?#?#?#?#? 1,3,1,6 - 1 arrangement
 * ????.#...#... 4,1,1 - 1 arrangement
 * ????.######..#####. 1,6,5 - 4 arrangements
 * ?###???????? 3,2,1 - 10 arrangements
 * Adding all of the possible arrangement counts together produces a total of 21 arrangements.
 *
 * For each row, count all of the different arrangements of operational and broken springs that meet the given
 * criteria. What is the sum of those counts?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 * As you look out at the field of springs, you feel like there are way more springs than the condition records list.
 * When you examine the records, you discover that they were actually folded up this whole time!
 *
 * To unfold the records, on each row, replace the list of spring conditions with five copies of itself (separated by
 * ?) and replace the list of contiguous groups of damaged springs with five copies of itself (separated by ,).
 *
 * So, this row:
 *
 * .# 1
 * Would become:
 *
 * .#?.#?.#?.#?.# 1,1,1,1,1
 * The first line of the above example would become:
 *
 * ???.###????.###????.###????.###????.### 1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1,3
 * In the above example, after unfolding, the number of possible arrangements for some rows is now much larger:
 *
 * ???.### 1,1,3 - 1 arrangement
 * .??..??...?##. 1,1,3 - 16384 arrangements
 * ?#?#?#?#?#?#?#? 1,3,1,6 - 1 arrangement
 * ????.#...#... 4,1,1 - 16 arrangements
 * ????.######..#####. 1,6,5 - 2500 arrangements
 * ?###???????? 3,2,1 - 506250 arrangements
 * After unfolding, adding all of the possible arrangement counts together produces 525152.
 *
 * Unfold your condition records; what is the new sum of possible arrangement counts?
