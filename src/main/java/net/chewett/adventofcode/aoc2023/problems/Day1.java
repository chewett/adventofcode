/**
 * --- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---
 * Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given
 * you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.
 *
 * You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by
 * December 25th.
 *
 * Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second
 * puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
 *
 * You try to ask why they can't just use a weather machine ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you
 * ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") and hang on did you just say the
 * sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a
 * trebuchet ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").
 *
 * As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been
 * amended by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are
 * having trouble reading the values on the document.
 *
 * The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific
 * calibration value that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining
 * the first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * 1abc2
 * pqr3stu8vwx
 * a1b2c3d4e5f
 * treb7uchet
 * In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces
 * 142.
 *
 * Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 * Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two,
 * three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".
 *
 * Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:
 *
 * two1nine
 * eightwothree
 * abcone2threexyz
 * xtwone3four
 * 4nineeightseven2
 * zoneight234
 * 7pqrstsixteen
 * In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.
